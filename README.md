# PlantOptimizer

An Arduino based project to implement smart blinds in my apartment that minimize heat during peak hours while maximizing light for my plants. 

Attempts to maximize growth conditions using temperature and moisture sensors while avoiding heat stress on plants due to heat buildup during the summer months.

## Hardware Requirements:
1. Arduino (I have an ELEGOO Aruduino Mega)
2. Water level detection sensor module
3. Temperature and humidity detection module
4. Continuous Rotation Servo Motor(s) (I am using a FS90R)
5. Breadboard
6. Power Supply Module if necessary (Servos can sometimes pull too much out of the 5V pins)
7. Male to Male connector wires
